          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2">Opening
Hi Guys! On the 19th of April, our community came back for another visit! This week’s session is a bit different from last weeks. Instead of learning, we emphasized creativity and did some fun art sessions with the kids. It was a bit chaotic, but overall a very fun experience, and we also got to see the kids' creative sides and their joy while doing it.

Content
Before we started our session, we saw how enthusiastic the kids were today. Many kids were running around chasing one another, playing bottle flips and even playing some traditional game of their own. And of course some of us even joined in with them. 

After playing around for quite awhile, we started with the main activity, making collage. Beforehand, we had already printed various things on paper such as turtles, birds, rockets etc. With some origami paper, the kids could cut it up into tiny pieces and fill up the picture with different colours however they want. During the session, we could see how some kids were really locked in and focused, which later on made some very neat and awesome pieces. Some of them even finished earlier than others, giving them the chance to make paper airplanes and play around for a while. 

Closing
Before we ended the session, we collected all the artworks they had made and gave them all a small goody bag filled with snacks. Afterwards, we invited the kids to help clean up the room as it was filled with papers and glue, teaching them to be responsible. Overall, we had a really fun time playing around and bonding with kids. We hope to see them again soon!

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2">Hey everyone!
In the 2nd week of April 2025, Promise returned for yet another exciting visit. This week, we picked up where we left off the week before and had a fun lesson on finance, learning about financial management, as well as primary and secondary needs.

Content 
We taught the kids about understanding important financial needs, like primary needs, secondary needs, clothing, and food needs. After the explanation, we jumped straight into practice. We had prepared engaging activities such as play shopping, where the kids could have a shopping simulation for their needs. The experiences and interactions from this session will leave a lasting impression and help the children develop a better understanding of financial decision-making. We are very proud of them for coming this far! 

Closing
Once we finished with our activity, we wrapped it up by discussing and teaching them how to make the best financial decision. We then closed today’s lesson by giving out snacks, which they received with glee. But soon, the time came for us to head home and bid a warm farewell to the kids. We look forward to the next visit next week! See you next week!
